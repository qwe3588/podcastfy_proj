</Person2><Person1> "Well, right now he's on garden leave from Two Sigma, where he was Senior VP of Product, Modeling Engineering. But that's not all - he's also faculty at Columbia University, mentoring at Correlation One, and even doing some GenAI work at Code.org.  Talk about a multi-hyphenate career!" 
</Person1><Person2> "Wow!  So, a blend of industry, academia, and non-profit work. It's impressive how he's managed to juggle it all." 
</Person2><Person1> "Exactly! His background is a mix of product development, quantitative analytics, and financial markets expertise. He's worked at places like Axioma, Yewno, even BM&FBOVESPA. Um,  That's the Brazilian stock exchange for our listeners who might not be familiar."

</Person1><Person2> "Persuasion? That's a unique addition to a tech-heavy resume.  I wonder how that plays into his work"

</Person1><Person2> "Right. And his master's thesis focused on finance and stochastic simulation on GPUs. That seems like a pretty forward-thinking area of research, even back then." 
</Person2><Person1> "Got it. Definitely.  His work at Two Sigma likely builds upon that foundation, given their focus on quantitative investment strategies." 
</Person1><Person2> "I'm also curious about his mentoring work with LatinX in AI and Data Science for All. That speaks to a commitment beyond just his own career advancement." 
</Person2><Person1> "Totally.   It shows a desire to give back and foster a more inclusive tech community, which is something we need more of."
